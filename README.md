### This project helps to develop microservices with Django Framework. No more hundreds of apps in one project. Split every app into separate project. That helps to develop more flexible and scalable projects.


---
> #### Note: First of all this is simple Django project with some customizations. If you are newbie in Django, you can use this project as a template for your own projects. I'm not very cool in programming, but I have some experience in Python and Django and want to share it with you.
---
> #### Not ready for production. Will be ready with version 1.0.0
